This directory includes a number of geo-referenced .tiff files to test the TIF format import into WED as 
 well as the geo-referencing functions.

Howto test:

Open the KSEA Demo Area scenery as included in X-plane.

Execute View -> Pick Overlay Image or File -> Import Orthophoto
Select all .tif files in this directory 

All images should result in visible Reference Images within the area of the KSEA airport. With exception
of "ksea_raw_nogeo.tif" they all should be aligned properly with the run & taxiways in the scenery.

Details about the images:

ksea_raw_nogeo.tif - Image uncompressed rgb8 format, *NO* geotiff tags - thats why it should *NOT*
                     be positioned or scaled right after import.

ksea_raw_wgs84.tif - same as before, but with geotiff tags in lat/long format, WGS84 referenced. 
                     Should work properly even with versions as old as WED 1.3

ksea_lzw_nad83.tif  - Image lzw compressed, geotiff in lat/lon format, NAD83 referenced. Typical of 
                      users unaware of the existence of other reference systems than WGS84

ksea_zip_utm10.tif  - Image deflate/zlib compressed, tiff tags in UTM raster, WGS84 referenced. 
                      Most commonly found on usgs earth-explorer aerial imagery.

ksea_jpeg_epsg3785.tif - Image jpeg compressed, geotiff tags in UTM raster, reference EPSG:3785. 
                         Most commonly used by Bing/Google derived sattelite imagery. 
                         Basical has no datum/ellipsoid/meridian information tags, but only refers 
                         to the SRS-designation EPSG:3785. All WED <1.7 lack the lookup tables to
                         expand this information into lat/long coordinates.
